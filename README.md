# PygameGUI
Large Pygame-based library for GUI elements and easy game design.

Physics and sprites are still works in progress and may not work as intended.

Requires Pygame >= 2.1 and Python >= 3.10.

EDIT: Somehow the files didn't upload, and I have lost the computer they were stored on, so I am reconstructing it. So far, I have only the bare minimum files for 'paint' project.
